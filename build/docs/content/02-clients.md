We provide clients in various languages for easing the interactions with the API.

## Go client

```bash
$ go get -u github.com/thecodingmachine/gotenberg-go-client/v7
```

See also the example from the [README](https://github.com/thecodingmachine/gotenberg-go-client/blob/master/README.md).

## PHP client

Unless your project already has a PSR7 `HttpClient`, install `php-http/guzzle6-adapter`:

```bash
$ composer require php-http/guzzle6-adapter
```

Then the [PHP client](https://github.com/thecodingmachine/gotenberg-php-client):

```bash
$ composer require thecodingmachine/gotenberg-php-client
```

See also the example from the [README](https://github.com/thecodingmachine/gotenberg-php-client/blob/master/README.md).
