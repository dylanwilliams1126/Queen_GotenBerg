title: Ping

Gotenberg provides the endpoint `/ping` for checking the API availability with
a simple `GET` request.

Currently this endpoint does nothing special. A better way to monitor
Gotenberg would be by checking the memory usage.

Also, as the API uses under the hood intricate programs, you should
restart your Gotenberg instances from time to time to ensure a nominal behaviour.
